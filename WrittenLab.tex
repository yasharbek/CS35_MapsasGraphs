\vspace*{5mm}\par\textbf{Problem 1.} Perform a breadth-first search of the graph starting from vertex A.  Give the number of steps to reach \emph{every} other vertex.  Additionally, give the order in which the vertices are \emph{first} witnessed; that is, give the order in which they first enter the queue (and not necessarily the order in which they are explored).\par

1 step: Vertex A, Vertex C

2 steps: Vertex D, Vertex E

3 steps: Vertex F

A enters the Queue; B and C then enter the Queue as they are neighbors of A;
D is neighbor of both B and C and E is the neighbor of B so they both
enter the Queue; Lastly, F is neighbors with both D and E so it enters the
Queue next.

\vspace*{10mm}\par\textbf{Problem 2.} Use Dijkstra's algorithm on this graph starting from vertex A.  Give the cost of the least-cost path to \emph{every} other vertex.  Additionally, give the order in which the vertices are \emph{first} witnessed; that is, give the order in which they first enter the queue (and not necessarily the order in which they are explored).\par

A-B: Weight 5

A-C: Weight 6

A-D: Weight 8

A-E: Weight 13

A-F: Weight 16

A starts in the priority Queue; B and C enter the priority Queue with weight
paths of 5 and 7; Then C (from B), D (from B), D (from C), and E are entered
into the Queue with weights 1, 4, 2, 8. There is a new lowest weight path from
A to C of 6, and the path from B to C to D is less weight that from B to D, so the
A to D lowest weight path is 8. The lowest weight path from A to E is through B
with a weight of 13; Lastly, F is entered into the Queue and has a lowest weight
path from A to B to C to D to F of 16.
\vspace*{10mm}\par\textbf{Problem 3.} Give two valid topological sorts of this graph.\par
